# Glossary

upstream project.

## SCA core

- **SCA — Software Composition Analysis.** The discipline of detecting
  third-party (open-source) components in a software project,
  classifying their licenses, and identifying their known
  vulnerabilities. TrustedOSS Portal is an SCA tool.
- **SBOM — Software Bill of Materials.** A machine-readable inventory
  of every component (and its version, license, and supplier) that
  ships with a piece of software. TrustedOSS Portal exports SBOMs in
  CycloneDX (JSON / XML) and SPDX (JSON / Tag-Value) formats. See
  [CISA SBOM resources](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom).
- **CycloneDX.** OWASP-maintained SBOM specification. TrustedOSS uses
  version 1.6 (JSON + XML). See
  [cyclonedx.org/specification](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/).
- **SPDX — Software Package Data Exchange.** Linux Foundation-maintained
  SBOM specification. TrustedOSS uses version 2.3 (JSON + Tag-Value).
  See [spdx.dev](https://spdx.dev/).

## Vulnerabilities

- **CVE — Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.** The
  industry-standard identifier for a publicly disclosed security flaw,
  formatted as `CVE-YYYY-NNNN`. Maintained by MITRE.
  See [cve.org](https://www.cve.org/).
- **CWE — Common Weakness Enumeration.** A taxonomy of software weakness
  types (e.g. CWE-79 Cross-site Scripting). Each CVE often references
  one or more CWE entries.
- **NVD — National Vulnerability Database.** NIST's analysis layer on
  top of CVE — adds CVSS scores, CPE matching, references. See
  [nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/).
- **OSV — Open Source Vulnerabilities database.** Google-led, ecosystem-
  scoped vulnerability database (npm, PyPI, Maven, etc.). See
  [osv.dev](https://osv.dev/).
- **GHSA — GitHub Security Advisory.** GitHub's per-ecosystem advisory
  feed. CVE IDs are often issued via GHSA.
- **VEX — Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange.** A document format for
  asserting whether a known vulnerability actually affects a given
  product. CycloneDX `analysis.state` and SPDX VEX are the two main
  encodings. TrustedOSS implements the 7-state CycloneDX model:
  `new`, `analyzing`, `exploitable`, `not_affected`, `false_positive`,
  `suppressed`, `fixed`. See
  [CycloneDX VEX](https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/vex/).

### VEX 7-state — action buttons per state

The vulnerability drawer's Analysis section shows up to seven action
buttons depending on the current state. The mapping is:

| Current state | Available actions (button labels) |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| `new` | Move to analyzing, Mark exploitable, Mark not affected, Mark false positive, Suppress, Mark fixed |
| `analyzing` | Mark exploitable, Mark not affected, Mark false positive, Suppress, Mark fixed |
| `exploitable` | Mark not affected, Mark false positive, Mark fixed |
| `not_affected` | Reopen as new, Mark exploitable, Mark fixed |
| `false_positive` | Reopen as new, Mark exploitable |
| `suppressed` | Reopen as new |
| `fixed` | Reopen as new |

Each button writes a `vulnerability_findings.update` row to `audit_logs`
with the `previous_status` → `new_status` transition in the `diff`
column.

## Tools

- **ORT — OSS Review Toolkit.** Scanner that walks a project's package
  ecosystem (Gradle, Maven, npm, pip, Cargo, …), resolves the
  dependency graph, and emits declared / detected licenses per
  component. TrustedOSS invokes ORT as the second stage of every
  source scan. See
  [oss-review-toolkit.org](https://oss-review-toolkit.org/).
- **cdxgen — CycloneDX Generator.** Component detector that produces
  CycloneDX SBOMs from 30+ language / build-system manifests
  (`package.json`, `pom.xml`, `requirements.txt`, …). Runs as the
  first scan stage before ORT.
- **Trivy.** Container and OS-package vulnerability scanner from
  Aqua Security. TrustedOSS uses Trivy for the container-scan
  pipeline (separate from the cdxgen + ORT source-scan path).
- **DT — Dependency-Track.** Vulnerability intelligence platform that
  mirrors NVD / OSV / GHSA and matches CVEs against your SBOMs.
  TrustedOSS bundles DT 4.x as an optional Docker Compose overlay and
  fronts it with a circuit-breaker + cache layer.
  See [dependencytrack.org](https://dependencytrack.org/).

## License classification

The portal classifies licenses into four **tiers**:

| Tier (code value) | UI label | Build-gate effect |
|-------------------|----------|-------------------|
| `forbidden` | Forbidden | Build fails — CI exit code 1 |
| `conditional` | Conditional | Requires component approval; warning until approved |
| `permissive` | Allowed | No restriction |
| `unknown` | Unknown | Surfaced for review; no automatic block |

The classification is driven by the
`_LICENSE_CATEGORY_DEFAULTS` dict in
`apps/backend/tasks/scan_source.py` (operator-side override path;
ORT-driven per-org rules are on the v2.2 roadmap). The values
`forbidden` / `conditional` / `permissive` / `unknown` appear in API
responses, audit logs, and policy gate verdicts; the UI labels
`Forbidden` / `Conditional` / `Allowed` / `Unknown` appear in tables
and badges. See
[Components & licenses](../user-guide/components-and-licenses.md#license-classification).

## Build gates

The portal exposes one CI-blocking mechanism, called the **build gate**
(also referred to as the **policy gate** in some operator-facing
contexts — they are the same thing). The gate evaluates:

1. Are there any CVEs at or above the project's severity floor (default
   `Critical`; per-project `policy_gate.severity_floor` is
   configurable)?
2. Are there any components in the `forbidden` license tier?

Either condition triggers exit code 1 in the CI integration's
composite action. A failed gate is recorded in `audit_logs` with the
list of offending CVEs / licenses.

## RBAC roles

- **`super_admin`** — system-wide. Manages users, teams, DT, scan
  queue, disk, audit. Created by the install wizard or the
  `create_super_admin.py` script.
- **`team_admin`** — bounded to a single team. Manages team settings,
  team members, and project visibility within the team.
- **`developer`** — bounded to a team's project set. Runs scans, views
  results, reviews approvals.

A single user may hold a different role in each team they belong to
(e.g. `team_admin` in team A and `developer` in team B); the
Memberships drawer in `/admin/users/<id>` shows all assignments.

## API key scopes

API keys carry a single **scope**:

| Scope | Issued by | Effect |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| `org` | super-admin only | Authenticates against any endpoint in the org |
| `team` | super-admin, team-admin | Bounded to one team's projects |
| `project` | super-admin, team-admin, developer (within their team's projects) | Bounded to one project |

There is no per-action allowlist at v2.0.0; any caller authenticated
with a key in the right scope can hit any endpoint that accepts an
API key. Per-action capabilities are on the roadmap.

## Operational terminology

- **Circuit breaker (CLOSED / OPEN / HALF_OPEN).** A failure-domain
  isolation pattern. TrustedOSS wraps the DT API client in a breaker:
  CLOSED = healthy, OPEN = DT unreachable (portal serves cached vuln
  data), HALF_OPEN = cooldown elapsed, next probe decides. See
  [On-call runbook → DT down](../admin-guide/oncall-runbook.md#scenario-1--dt-down--15-min).
- **`audit_logs`.** Append-only table capturing every state-changing
  operation (CRUD on first-class entities, plus explicit business
  events). See [Audit log](../admin-guide/audit-log.md).
- **Workspace.** Per-scan checkout directory under
  `/opt/trustedoss/workspace` (host) / `/workspace` (container).
  Cleaned up by the disk-pressure subsystem (> 30 days idle).
