# Disk & system health

The portal exposes two operator dashboards under `/admin`:

- **/admin/health** — current state of every container service plus the DT connector.
- **/admin/disk** — workspace and database storage usage with a configurable hard limit.

![Admin Disk usage — workspace + database cards with usage gauges](/img/screenshots/admin-disk-list.png)

Together they let you catch problems before users notice.

## System health dashboard {#health}

The **/admin/health** page lists every component the portal depends on. Each row shows:

- **Component** — one of `postgres`, `redis`, `celery`, `dt`, `disk`, `active_scans`, `last_24h_errors`.
- **State** — `ok` (green), `degraded` (yellow), `down` (red). The label rendered in the UI is locale-aware (the EN locale shows "OK / Degraded / Down"), but the API contract emits the lower-case enum above.
- **Last check** — timestamp of the most recent probe.
- **Detail** — error message or telemetry summary when the state is not `ok`.

The dashboard auto-refreshes via React Query polling (default 30 s; the user can pause polling from the page header). It is not a WebSocket stream — operators who want a wall display can leave the tab open and rely on the polling refresh.

### Health probes

Each row maps to a real probe in `services/admin_health_service.py`:

| Component | Probe |
|---|---|
| `postgres` | `SELECT 1` over the application's asyncpg pool. |
| `redis` | `redis-cli ping`-equivalent through the asyncio client. |
| `celery` | Celery `inspect ping` returns within the configured timeout. |
| `dt` | DT health probe (see [DT connector → health monitor](./dt-connector.md#operational-layers)). DT is the one component with a fail-count counter — three consecutive misses flip it to `down`; the others use single-shot evaluation. |
| `disk` | Workspace volume usage compared to the warn / critical thresholds. |
| `active_scans` | Count of scans currently in `running` state — informational, surfaces to `degraded` when the queue length crosses an internal threshold. |
| `last_24h_errors` | Count of `ERROR`-level structured-log events in the last 24 h — informational. |

The portal does not separately probe `backend`, `worker`, `beat`, `frontend`, or `traefik`. Their liveness is implicit: if the dashboard renders at all, the backend is up; if the `celery` row is `ok`, the worker (and the broker the worker depends on) are reachable.

## Disk dashboard {#disk}

**/admin/disk** renders one card per filesystem the portal cares about. The actual cards in v2.0.0 are: **workspace**, **dt_volume**, **postgres**, **redis** (the API returns them as `items: AdminDiskItem[]` and the page renders one card per item).

Each card has a warn threshold and a critical threshold:

| Threshold | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **Warn** | 80% | Yellow card, dashboard banner, no other side effect. |
| **Critical** | 90% | Red card, dashboard banner, an admin notification fires. |

Override in `.env`:

```bash
DISK_THRESHOLD_WARNING_PCT=80
DISK_THRESHOLD_CRITICAL_PCT=90
```

Separately, the **scan disk-guard** uses a single `DISK_HARD_LIMIT_PCT` (default `95`) to **block new scans** when the workspace volume crosses that line. Cross-reference is intentional: the dashboard warns earlier (80% / 90%), the scan guard kicks in later (95%) to stop the bleed without surprising the operator.

```bash
DISK_HARD_LIMIT_PCT=95
```

### What "scans blocked" means

When `DISK_HARD_LIMIT_PCT` trips, `POST /v1/projects/{id}/scans` returns:

```json
{
  "type": "about:blank",
  "title": "Workspace Disk Full",
  "status": 503,
  "detail": "Workspace is at 96% (hard limit 95%). Free space and try again.",
  "instance": "/v1/projects/01H…/scans"
}
```

Existing in-flight scans are **not** killed; only new submissions are rejected. This avoids losing work but stops the bleed.

## What to do when disk fills up

### 1. Identify the offender

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml exec backend \
  du -sh /workspace/*  | sort -h | tail -20
```

Most often a single project's repo + ORT analyzer output dominates the workspace. The `cdxgen` cache also grows over time.

### 2. Free space

```bash
# Drop ORT analyzer outputs older than 30 days (safe — rebuilt on next scan).
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml exec backend \
  find /workspace -name "analyzer-result.yml" -mtime +30 -delete

# Drop entire workspace directories for projects that have been archived.
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml exec backend \
  rm -rf /workspace/<archived-project-id>/
```

### 3. Verify

After cleanup, **/admin/disk** updates within ~10 seconds. Once below the hard threshold, scans are accepted again automatically — no service restart needed.

### 4. Long-term remediation

- Move `WORKSPACE_HOST_PATH` to a larger volume (edit `.env`, restart `backend`, `worker`).
- Lower `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` if local backups are eating space.
- Move backups off-host (S3, NFS) and skip local pruning.

## Notification triggers

Disk pressure does not generate a notification today; operators are expected to monitor `/admin/disk` directly. A `disk_pressure` notification kind is on the roadmap.

## /admin/scans — Scan queue and worker monitoring

The `/admin/scans` page (super-admin only) lists every running, queued, succeeded, and failed scan across the org. Operators can:

- Inspect any task's full progress payload + last log frame.
- Force-cancel a stuck scan (`POST /v1/admin/scans/{scan_id}/cancel`).
- Filter by status, kind, project, or assigned worker.

Backend: `apps/backend/api/v1/admin/scans.py`. UI: `apps/frontend/src/features/admin/scans/AdminScansPage.tsx`.

## Verify it worked

After making changes:

1. **/admin/health** is all green.
2. **/admin/disk** is below the warn line.
3. A test scan against any project succeeds end-to-end.

## Troubleshooting

:::info Logs to check first
- `docker-compose logs --tail=200 backend | grep disk_threshold` — the threshold check task's last verdict.
- `/admin/disk` API — per-card breakdown JSON (workspace, dt_volume, postgres, redis).
- Host: `df -h /opt/trustedoss && docker system df`.

### Health page says everything is `healthy` but users complain

The dashboard is a snapshot of liveness, not full functionality. Liveness can pass while:

- The worker has accepted tasks but is hung on a sub-process (very rare). Restart the worker.
- DT is `healthy` but its NVD mirror is stale. Trigger a manual resync — see [DT connector](./dt-connector.md#troubleshooting).

### Disk gauge is wrong

The gauge reads the host-mounted volume from inside the backend container. If you changed `WORKSPACE_HOST_PATH` recently and forgot to restart, the gauge points at the old volume. Restart the backend.

### Hard limit is too aggressive

Raise it. 95% is a conservative default for `DISK_HARD_LIMIT_PCT` that gives operators room to react before the host runs out. If your monitoring catches issues earlier, you can lower it. Routinely operating above the warn threshold (80%) is a sign you should add disk.

## Roadmap (v2.x)

The following affordances are referenced in early docs but are **not** shipped at v2.0.0:

- Per-component liveness probes for `backend`, `worker`, `beat`, `frontend`, and `traefik` on the health dashboard (today these are inferred from the dashboard rendering and the `celery` row).
- WebSocket-streamed health updates (today the dashboard uses React Query polling).
- Multi-shot consecutive-miss state machine for non-DT components (today only `dt` carries a fail-count counter).
