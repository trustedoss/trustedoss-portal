# SBOM

The portal generates **Software Bill of Materials** (SBOM) artifacts from the latest successful scan. Four interchange formats are supported, plus an attribution `NOTICE` file.

:::note Audience
Engineers shipping releases, compliance leads filing artifacts, customers fulfilling SBOM requests under [EO 14028](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/cybersecurity-best-practices/secure-by-design/sbom). Read access via team membership.

## Supported formats

| Format | Query value (`format=`) | MIME | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CycloneDX 1.6 (JSON)** | `cyclonedx-json` | `application/vnd.cyclonedx+json` | Modern de-facto standard for SCA tooling. Includes VEX. |
| **CycloneDX 1.6 (XML)** | `cyclonedx-xml` | `application/vnd.cyclonedx+xml` | Same data; XML for legacy tooling. |
| **SPDX 2.3 (JSON)** | `spdx-json` | `application/spdx+json` | NTIA minimum elements; broadly accepted in regulated industries. |
| **SPDX 2.3 (Tag-Value)** | `spdx-tv` | `text/spdx` | The original SPDX line-based format. |

Both formats are produced from the same internal model, so component lists are identical (modulo format-specific fields).

## Byte-stable output

All four exports are **byte-stable**: re-exporting the same scan produces identical bytes. This makes diffing, signing, and caching trivial.

The portal achieves byte-stability by:

- Sorting components by `purl` (lexicographic).
- Sorting license expressions alphabetically within each component.
- Pinning `serialNumber` (CycloneDX) / `documentNamespace` (SPDX) to a deterministic value derived from `(project_id, scan_id)`.
- Omitting timestamps from the body (the SBOM's metadata records the scan finish time, which is stable per scan).

## Download from the UI

1. Open the project.
2. Click the **SBOM** tab.
3. Click one of the four format buttons (CycloneDX JSON, CycloneDX XML, SPDX JSON, SPDX Tag-Value) to download.

![SBOM tab — four format download buttons (CycloneDX JSON/XML, SPDX JSON/Tag-Value)](/img/screenshots/user-sbom-format-buttons.png)

The file name is `sbom-<project-slug>.<ext>`.

## Download from the API

```bash
# CycloneDX JSON
curl -sS -L -OJ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TRUSTEDOSS_API_KEY}" \
  "https://trustedoss.example.com/v1/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/sbom?format=cyclonedx-json"

# SPDX JSON
curl -sS -L -OJ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TRUSTEDOSS_API_KEY}" \
  "https://trustedoss.example.com/v1/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/sbom?format=spdx-json"
```

`format` accepts: `cyclonedx-json`, `cyclonedx-xml`, `spdx-json`, `spdx-tv`.

Endpoint always exports the **latest succeeded** scan's SBOM; pinning to a specific historical scan id is on the roadmap.

## NOTICE file

For Apache-2.0 §4(d) compliance and similar attribution obligations, the portal auto-generates a `NOTICE.txt` from the project's latest scan.

The file contains:

- A header with the project name and scan timestamp.
- For each component: name, version, license, copyright statement (when ORT extracted one), and a link to the upstream license text.
- Grouped by license to make the redistribution package straightforward.

### Download

- **UI:** Project → **Obligations** tab → **Download NOTICE**.
- **API:**

  ```bash
  curl -sS -L -OJ \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TRUSTEDOSS_API_KEY}" \
    "https://trustedoss.example.com/v1/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/notice"
  ```

The `NOTICE` file is byte-stable across exports — diffable across releases.

## VEX exports

CycloneDX SBOMs include the project's VEX state for every finding. SPDX does not have a native VEX representation, so SPDX exports omit per-finding state; pair an SPDX export with a separate CycloneDX VEX document if your downstream consumer expects it.

The VEX states map directly to CycloneDX's `analysis.state`:

| Portal state | CycloneDX VEX `state` | `justification` |
|---|---|---|
| `New` | `in_triage` | (none) |
| `Analyzing` | `in_triage` | analyst note |
| `Exploitable` | `exploitable` | analyst note |
| `Not affected` | `not_affected` | reason text (`code_not_present`, `vulnerable_code_not_in_execute_path`, …) |
| `False positive` | `false_positive` | analyst note |
| `Suppressed` | `not_affected` | reason text |
| `Fixed` | `resolved` | (`fix_version` populated) |

## Verify it worked

1. The downloaded SBOM passes a validator — for CycloneDX, run [`cyclonedx validate`](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-cli):

   ```bash
   cyclonedx validate --input-file checkout-service.sbom.json
   ```

2. SPDX validates with [`spdx-tools`](https://github.com/spdx/tools-python):

   ```bash
   pyspdxtools -i checkout-service.sbom.json
   ```

3. Re-downloading the same scan produces a byte-identical file:

   ```bash
   sha256sum checkout-service.sbom.json checkout-service.sbom.json.again
   # → identical hashes
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Empty SBOM when no scan has succeeded yet

If the project has no succeeded scan yet, the export still returns a valid SBOM document with empty `components`/`packages` lists (HTTP 200) so downstream tooling can parse it.

### `422` from `/sbom?format=…`

The query string used a value the API does not accept. Use one of the four canonical query values from the table above — in particular, **the SPDX Tag-Value format is `spdx-tv` (not `spdx-tag-value`)**.

### NOTICE file is missing copyrights for some components

ORT extracts copyrights from license headers. Some packages omit them; the NOTICE entry will say "Copyright holder unspecified".

## Roadmap (v2.x)

Items the manual previously promised that are not in v2.0.0; tracked for later releases.

- Excel / PDF reports — Components Excel, Vulnerabilities Excel, Compliance PDF — are not implemented at v2.0.0; the **Reports** menu and `/v1/projects/{id}/reports/...` endpoints will land in a later release. Stakeholders who need a tabular view today should consume the SBOM (CycloneDX JSON) via their preferred tooling.
- Manual copyright override in the component drawer for NOTICE assembly — planned for v2.2.
