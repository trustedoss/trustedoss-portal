# Upgrade

The `scripts/upgrade.sh` wrapper performs an **in-place** upgrade of a running install. It always takes a pre-upgrade backup before touching anything, and it leans on `docker-compose pull` + `up -d` so only services whose image hash changed get recreated.

:::note Audience
Operators with `sudo` on the host that runs the portal. Familiarity with `docker-compose ps` / `logs`.
:::

## Compatibility & policy

- **Forward-only Alembic migrations.** TrustedOSS Portal does not support `alembic downgrade`. To revert, restore the pre-upgrade backup (see [Rollback](#rollback)).
- **Minor / patch upgrades** within the same major version are always supported in place. **Major upgrades** (e.g., 2.x → 3.x) are documented in dedicated release notes; do not run `scripts/upgrade.sh` blindly across major versions.
- **Downtime expectation:** the portal is briefly unavailable while `docker-compose up -d` recreates services whose image changed. Typical window is under 30 seconds.

## Prerequisites

- A previous successful install (i.e. `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml ps` shows healthy services).
- `docker-compose` (V1) on PATH.
- At least 5 GB free disk for the new image layers and the pre-upgrade backup.
- The intended `IMAGE_TAG` is in `.env` (or the wizard accepts the default `2.0.0`). If you maintain a private registry, `IMAGE_TAG` should match the manifest published there.

## Step 1 — Inspect the upgrade window

Find a quiet moment (no scans in flight). The dashboard `/scans` view shows the global queue; wait until it drains.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml ps
```

Every row should be `Up (healthy)`. If any row is restarting or unhealthy, fix that first — do not stack an upgrade on a broken install.

## Step 2 — Run the upgrade wrapper

```bash
bash scripts/upgrade.sh
```

Flow:

1. **Pre-upgrade backup** — `bash scripts/backup.sh` (mandatory, no flag to skip).
2. **`docker-compose pull`** — fetches the new images.
3. **`docker-compose up -d`** — recreates only services whose image hash changed.
4. **`alembic upgrade head`** — applies any new migrations.
5. **Health probe** — polls `/health` for up to 60 seconds.

A successful run ends with:

```text
✓ backend is healthy
Upgrade complete
  If something looks off, restore the pre-upgrade backup:
  bash scripts/restore.sh $(ls -td backups/* | head -1)
```

## Step 3 — Verify the upgrade

1. Sign in to the portal.
2. Visit **/admin/health** — every component should be green.
3. Trigger a small scan against a known project (or re-scan the most recently scanned one). Watch the WebSocket progress feed go to **Completed**.
4. If the release notes call out new admin screens or settings, walk them once.

## Rollback

If the upgrade left the portal broken, restore the pre-upgrade backup:

```bash
bash scripts/restore.sh "$(ls -td backups/* | head -1)"
```

`scripts/restore.sh` will:

1. Confirm the destructive action interactively (type **y**).
2. Stop application containers (`backend`, `frontend`, `worker`, `beat`). PostgreSQL and Redis stay up so the dump can stream straight in.
3. Restore the PostgreSQL dump (`postgres.sql.gz`).
4. Restore the workspace tarball (`workspace.tar.gz`) if present.
5. Restart the application containers.
6. Verify the Alembic head matches the backup's `manifest.json`.

If `manifest.json` is missing or the head does not match, the script prints a warning and you should run `alembic upgrade head` manually.

:::warning Data loss
`restore.sh` **replaces** the live database content and the `WORKSPACE_HOST_PATH` directory. There is no undo. Make sure the backup you point at is the right one (`ls -td backups/*` prints newest first).
:::

## Skipping versions

A single `upgrade.sh` run can hop multiple versions provided each intermediate has a forward-only migration path. The migration chain is exercised end-to-end in CI, so 2.0.0 → 2.0.5 in one step is supported.

For major-version hops, follow the release-notes "Migration steps" section before invoking the wrapper.

## Common issues

### `alembic upgrade head` fails with a constraint violation

Usually a real data issue: a NOT-NULL column was added but a row predates the default value. Restore the backup, inspect the offending rows, and report the migration in the issue tracker.

### Health probe times out after 60 seconds

The pull may have brought down a service that needs a longer warm-up (e.g. worker after a JRE upgrade). Tail the logs:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml logs --tail=200 backend worker
```

If the backend is up but the worker is not, scans will queue but never run. Restart the worker manually:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml restart worker beat
```

### Image pull rejected (403 / 401)

Your registry credentials expired. Re-authenticate:

```bash
docker login <your-registry>
```

Then re-run `bash scripts/upgrade.sh`.
