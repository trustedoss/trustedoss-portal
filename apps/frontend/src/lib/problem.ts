/**
 * RFC 7807 Problem Details — shared error type used by every HTTP layer.
 *
 * Originally lived in `lib/authApi.ts` (PR #6 / 1.6, fetch-based). Promoted
 * out so the axios surface in `lib/api.ts` (PR #6 / 1.7) can throw the same
 * shape and the auth pages don't have to learn a second error class.
 *
 * Contract:
 *   - `status === 0` is reserved for transport-level failures (network, CORS,
 *     DNS, aborted). The backend never returns 0.
 *   - `detail` is always populated (falls back to `title`) so the UI can
 *     render `err.detail` without further branching.
 *   - `problem` is the parsed JSON when the server returned `application/
 *     problem+json`; `null` when the body wasn't JSON or the request never
 *     reached the server.
 *
 * Extension hardening (security-reviewer F10):
 *   RFC 7807 §3.2 allows arbitrary "extension members" alongside the standard
 *   fields. The previous parser passed them through with an unbounded index
 *   signature — a future backend change that accidentally puts a sensitive
 *   shape into a Problem extension would silently round-trip through this
 *   layer. We now run extensions through a zod schema that:
 *     - whitelists the known domain extension keys (last_super_admin_protected,
 *       cannot_modify_self, team_has_active_scans, last_team_admin_protected,
 *       team_id from F9, etc.) with explicit types;
 *     - accepts unknown keys ONLY as JSON primitives (string / number /
 *       boolean / null) — nested objects and arrays from unknown extension
 *       keys are dropped with a console warning so a leak of a sensitive
 *       shape (e.g. a stack trace nested under an unfamiliar key) is
 *       prevented automatically.
