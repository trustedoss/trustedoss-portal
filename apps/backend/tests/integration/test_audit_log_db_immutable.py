"""DB-level immutability for ``audit_logs`` (A1 / sys-bug-audit-1).

Migration ``0012_audit_logs_immutable_trigger`` attaches a BEFORE UPDATE OR
DELETE trigger that raises SQLSTATE 23000 on any mutation. These tests
exercise the trigger directly against a fresh ``audit_logs`` row to confirm:

  - INSERT works (the listener path stays functional).
  - UPDATE raises IntegrityError mentioning ``TG_OP=UPDATE``.
  - DELETE raises IntegrityError mentioning ``TG_OP=DELETE``.
  - Adversarial column subsets (only ``action``; only ``ip``; ``diff`` JSONB
    overwrite) all hit the trigger — there is no "edit one column" loophole.
