"""
Service-layer tests for `services/project_service.py` — Phase 2 PR #7.

These run against the live Postgres (DATABASE_URL must be set) because the
service is essentially "translate validated payloads into SQL" — mocking the
DB would test the mock, not the contract.

We exercise the service functions directly (no HTTP) to keep the assertions
focused on the domain rules:

    - team-scoped reads (list_projects)
    - IDOR guards (get_project across teams)
    - role gating (update / archive require team_admin)
    - super_admin bypasses team membership
    - slug uniqueness (409)
    - audit log entries on every mutation

File lives under tests/unit/ to match the project convention even though
"unit" here means "service-level" — the integration suite (tests/integration/)
is reserved for HTTP-level coverage.
