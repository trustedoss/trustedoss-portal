"""
Service-layer tests for `services/scan_service.py` — Phase 2 PR #7.

PR #7 only persists the `scans` row with status='queued' and celery_task_id=
None — there is no Celery enqueue yet. These tests pin:

  - happy-path trigger persists status='queued' + progress_percent=0 + audit log
  - the partial unique index `ix_scans_project_active` produces a 409 on a
    second concurrent trigger (and that the gate releases when the first scan
    moves to a terminal status)
  - cross-team guards on trigger and read (IDOR)
  - super_admin bypass
  - list pagination

We drive the service directly (no HTTP); the API surface is covered in
`tests/integration/test_scans_api.py`.
