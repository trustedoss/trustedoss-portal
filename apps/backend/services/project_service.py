Project domain services — Phase 2 PR #7.

The router (`api/v1/projects.py`) is a thin shell: it only translates HTTP
into service calls and turns these domain exceptions into RFC 7807. All DB
I/O — including IDOR / RBAC enforcement — lives here.

Cross-team data isolation is the most important contract in this module:
  - `list_projects` always restricts the returned rows to the actor's team
    set unless the actor is a super_admin.
  - `get_project`, `update_project`, `archive_project` re-check team membership
    at read time. Even if the caller crafts a UUID belonging to another team,
    the service raises `ProjectForbidden` (mapped to 403 in the router).

Phase 3+ TODO: when organization-wide visibility is enabled in the API,
`list_projects` will also include projects with visibility='organization'
that share the actor's organization_id. For PR #7 only visibility='team' is
writable so the additional clause is intentionally absent.
