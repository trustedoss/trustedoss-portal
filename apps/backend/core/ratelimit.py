Rate-limiting configuration — slowapi.

Phase 1 PR #5 — task 1.5.

CLAUDE.md §3 baseline: 5 login attempts per minute per IP. The default
per-route policy is empty so we only apply limits where explicitly decorated.

The 429 handler emits an RFC 7807 problem+json body with a `Retry-After`
header. Unit tests call the handler directly to assert the contract.

H-4 (security-reviewer blocker):
  - The key function must honour `X-Forwarded-For` so reverse proxies in
    front of FastAPI (Traefik, nginx, GCP LB) report the real client IP
    instead of the proxy's loopback. Without this every caller shares the
    same bucket and the limiter becomes a global rate cap.
  - Storage is Redis (shared across uvicorn workers / Celery beats), not
    slowapi's default in-memory dict, so the 5/min budget is enforced
    correctly under multi-worker deployments.
