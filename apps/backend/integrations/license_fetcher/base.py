"""
Shared types + helpers for the multi-ecosystem license fetcher.

Why this exists
---------------
cdxgen extracts ``components[].licenses`` from package metadata, but for
transitive dependencies that metadata is often empty — the 2026-05-07 UAT
matrix (`docs/sessions/2026-05-07-uat-multi-ecosystem-matrix.md` §4.1)
counted 91 unknown licenses in pilot-java-maven, 39 in pilot-python, 164
in pilot-rust, 29 in pilot-go. The ``LicenseFetcher`` protocol gives us a
narrow surface to fill those gaps from each ecosystem's authoritative
registry (Maven Central, PyPI, crates.io, pkg.go.dev) without coupling
the scan pipeline to the per-registry HTTP shape.

Design notes
------------
* **Stateless protocol.** Each fetcher exposes ``fetch(purl, *, timeout)``
  and returns ``LicenseFetchResult | None``. ``None`` means *unknown* —
  the upstream registry returned no license metadata, or returned a
  free-text expression we cannot reduce to an SPDX id. ``None`` is
  cached as a *negative* entry (24h TTL) so we don't hammer external
  APIs for the same dead lookup.
* **HTTP via httpx.** The project already pins httpx for the DT client;
  reusing it (instead of pulling in ``requests``) keeps the dependency
  surface narrow and lets unit tests reuse the existing
  ``httpx.MockTransport`` pattern. Per-host concurrency limiting is
  enforced by a small in-process semaphore registry — Celery workers
  are single-process by default, so this is sufficient.
* **No env caching.** ``CLAUDE.md`` core rule #11 forbids module-level
  env access, so the fetchers resolve any tunables at call time.
