"""
Pydantic schemas for the Component Approval Workflow — Phase 4 PR #15.

Public shapes:
  - ApprovalOut       — single approval row returned to the caller
  - ApprovalListPage  — paginated list wrapper
  - ApprovalCreateIn  — request body for POST /v1/approvals
  - ApprovalTransitionIn — request body for PATCH /v1/approvals/{id}/transition

Design notes:
  - ApprovalOut uses ConfigDict(from_attributes=True) so SQLAlchemy ORM instances
    can be validated directly with model_validate(row).
  - ApprovalStatus is imported from the model so both layers share the same enum.
  - decision_note is bounded to 2000 chars at the schema layer; the DB column is
    unbounded TEXT, but we enforce the limit here before the row ever reaches
    Postgres.
  - Literal["under_review", "approved", "rejected"] on the transition action
    surfaces cleanly in OpenAPI and constrains the Pydantic validation to only the
    actor-trigerable transitions (pending is the server-assigned initial state, so
    callers never request it directly).
