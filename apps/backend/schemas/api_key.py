"""
Pydantic schemas for API Key management — Phase 5 PR #16.

Public shapes:
  - APIKeyCreateIn        — request body for POST /v1/api-keys
  - APIKeyCreateOut       — response with the plaintext (returned ONCE)
  - APIKeyListItem        — list-row shape (no plaintext, no hash)
  - APIKeyListPage        — paginated list wrapper
  - APIKeyScope           — Literal type alias for the closed scope set

Design notes:
  - APIKeyCreateOut.raw_key is the plaintext bearer string
    (``tos_<prefix>_<secret>``). It is returned exactly once at issuance and
    intentionally NOT stored on the server side. The list endpoint NEVER echoes
    the plaintext — clients must capture it from the create response or rotate
    the key.
  - APIKeyListItem omits ``key_hash`` so a leaky serializer (e.g. a future bug
    that round-trips ORM rows directly) cannot accidentally surface the hash.
  - Literal types on ``scope`` give us crisp OpenAPI + Pydantic v2 validation;
    a bogus value fails fast with a 422 RFC 7807 envelope.
