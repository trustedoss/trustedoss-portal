Celery application bootstrap.

Phase 0 PR #2 stood up the worker process. Phase 2 PR #8 registers the real
scan tasks (``scan_source``, ``scan_container``), the DT health/resync/orphan
tasks, and the corresponding Beat schedule.

CLAUDE.md core rule #11: environment variables are read inside the factory at
process startup, not cached as module-level constants. The Beat schedule
itself is built from constants — changing the cadence requires a code change,
which is the right granularity for cron-shaped configuration.

Task module loading:
    Celery autodiscovers task modules listed in ``include=``. We list each
    Phase 2 task module so the worker registers them on boot. Importing here
    ensures the task names are bound to ``celery_app`` (not a different
    Celery() instance constructed elsewhere).
