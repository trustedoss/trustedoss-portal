"""
Source scan Celery task — cdxgen → ORT → DT upload → DT findings.

CLAUDE.md core rule #3: this pipeline runs asynchronously inside a Celery
worker; the FastAPI request handler that triggered the scan only persisted a
``Scan`` row in state ``queued``.

CLAUDE.md core rule #4: every DT call goes through the circuit breaker. When
the breaker is OPEN (DT is down), the task does the best it can with cached
data — vulnerability findings cannot be produced for the current scan, but
the SBOM + license findings are still persisted, the scan is marked
``failed`` with a clear ``error_message``, and the next scan will retry once
the breaker recovers. Phase 6 will add a "deferred" outbox so OPEN-at-upload
scans automatically replay; #8 keeps the simpler "fail with breaker_open
reason" behavior.

Idempotency:
    The task is keyed off ``scan_id``. On re-execution (Celery
    ``task_acks_late=True`` + worker restart) we:
      1. Skip immediately if the scan already reached ``succeeded``.
      2. Otherwise, treat the run as a fresh start: delete prior
         ScanComponent / VulnerabilityFinding / LicenseFinding rows for this
         scan, recreate the workspace, and re-run every stage.
    This is simpler than checkpointing per stage and is correct because the
    DB partial unique index already enforces "at most one in-flight scan per
    project" — a re-execution cannot collide with a parallel scan.

Workspace:
    Each task creates ``${WORKSPACE_HOST_PATH}/<scan_id>/`` and removes it in
    ``finally``. We use ``shutil.rmtree(..., ignore_errors=True)`` because
    user-policy forbids ``rm`` shell calls and a partial cleanup on shutdown
    is acceptable — the orphan workspace cleaner (Phase 2.8) reclaims any
    leftover trees that survive a SIGKILL.

    Behaviour today (Phase 2 PR #9):
        - Validate ``git_url`` via :func:`validate_git_url_with_ip` so a
          worker that runs minutes after schema validation re-checks the
          host. This closes I-1 (DNS rebinding TOCTOU) at the worker
          boundary even though the actual clone is still mocked.
        - Materialise an empty ``source/`` directory + placeholder file so
          downstream stages have something to point at.

    Behaviour tomorrow (when ``mock_only=False``):
        - Spawn ``git -c http.curloptResolve=<host>:443:<resolved_ip> clone``
          with the validated URL. Pinning the resolved IP at the libcurl
          layer means even if the DNS for the host has rotated to an
          internal address since validation, the connection lands on the
          public IP we already screened.

    The dead-code clone branch is intentionally written out (rather than
    a TODO comment) so the IP-pin wiring is reviewable today and dropping
    a real ``subprocess.run`` call into it later is a one-line change.

    Raises:
        _FetchAborted: when the URL fails the SSRF guard. The task body
            catches this and transitions the scan to ``failed`` with a

    materialise — this was the false-empty seen across the UAT pilots.

    Strategy: sleep, then poll. Total budget is the sum of
